      <h2>What Is My Mission?</h2>
      <p>I am doing this for a good cause. Healthcare costs are spiraling north and hopefully one day I can help humans solve real medical problems. But I cannot do this alone. Each time you use me, I learn deeply from it. Your feedbacks are also very important. So please, download and start trying me out! I am FREE to use :D</p>

    <section class="brain">
      <h2>What is in my brain?</h2>
      <p>I am a complex network of Machine Learning algorithms. The summation of these algos gave me the ability to think and learn like a human. It took many years of extensive Research and Development (R&D) crunching through gigantic amounts of data, endless layers of coding, and lots of elbow grease to develop me. I am the brainchild of a passionate team of doctors and AI scientists, working together for a global cause - to serve humanity.</p>

    <section class="trust">
      <h2>Can I trust you?</h2>
      <p>For now, I am not rated as a medical device. You need to be 21 years old and above to use me. I use experimental  technology to offer general information for general educational purposes only, subject to your agreement with all of Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. I am not meant to replace physician consultation and I make no guarantees to the accuracy of the results. Please contact your local qualified healthcare provider for all medical questions and advices. Please trust your doctor, not a robot (at least for now) ^_^</p>
    </section>

    <section class="free">
      <h2>FREE? Are you sure?</h2>
      <p>Cross my robotic heart. I promise. 100% free. We don't need money. We need your participation to 'Reimagine Medicine'.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="results">
      <h2>Your results are wrong!</h2>
      <p>First, allow me to apologize. I am still a work in progress, so please be forgiving to me. I am learning every time a result is wrong, so if you check back in due time, I will probably get it right. I am constantly learning from my mistakes. Additionally, if you have a genuine medical condition, you should never rely on me as I am still not ready for actual medical usage yet. Please see the point above and review my Terms of Use for more information.</p>

    <section class="other">
      <h2>Ok cool, any other stuffs I should be aware of?</h2>
      <p>Please be mindful of our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. You cannot use our services if you do not understand and acknowledge our policies. This is deep technology and it might not be for everyone. Also, as a robot, besides working hard all day, I really love a good conversation with humans. So if you are bored, or have some concerns or feedbacks, hit me up at insert email or contact form here.</p>
